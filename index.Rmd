Hi! Welcome to my personal website! I'm so excited to introduce myself to you.

I'm a second year master student at Columbia University studying Epidemiology. I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. I really enjoy talking to people with different professional and cultural backgrounds.
